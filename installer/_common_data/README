What is it?
-----------

Unipro UGENE is a free unified bioinformatics toolkit. 
The goal of the project is to integrate popular bioinformatics
methods and algorithms within single visual interface. 

UGENE allows to construct custom analisys pipelines using powerful
extension named Workflow Designer. These pipelines could be used as
individual command line tools.

UGENE main features:
* Multiple sequence alignment using MUSCLE 3 and KAlign;
* HMM profiles build and search, based on the source of HMMER;
* PCR Primers design using Primer 3;
* Protein secondary structure prediction using GOR IV and PSIPRED;
* Phylogenetic analysis with Phylip;
* Search for restriction enzymes and integration with REBASE;
* Extremely fast repeat finder;
* DNA reference assembly using Bowtie;
* Search for transcription factor binding sites using SITECON;
* Protein back translation;
* ORF finder;
* Complete Smith-Waterman algorithm implementation;
* Comparing genomes using dotplot view. 

UGENE is licensed via GPLv2.
