Creating a binary snapshot for Linux

1) Build Qt 

Set correct configuration for qt
./configure -release -opensource -no-qt3support -no-phonon -nomake demos -nomake examples -nomake docs -sm -openssl -gtkstyle

Probably you will have to install some additional libraries to enable this configuration.
For example: to build on Ubuntu 8.10 you have to install the following packages
libxext-dev
libglu1-mesa-dev
libgtk2.0-dev
xlibs-dev
libsm-dev
libssl-dev

2) Build UGENE in release mode

Set UGENE_EXCLUDE_LIST_ENABLED=1  

3) launch ./create_bundle.sh from trunk/installer/linux/X11/

Remember: for std c++ lib compatibility you have to build on the lowest system which you would like to support since std lib doesn't have backward compatibility.

4) To run console version of UGENE use 'ugene' command.
   To run GUI version of UGENE use 'ugene -ui' command.
