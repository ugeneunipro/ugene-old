#@UGENE_WORKFLOW
#The workflow takes FASTQ files as input and process this data as follows:
#    - Filters the input sequencing reads by the CASAVA header (for Illumina platform).
#    - Cuts of adapter sequences.
#    - Trims the sequencing reads by quality.
#    - Merges different FASTQ files.
#    - [Optionally] Maps the sequencing reads by TopHat. You can skip this step, if after running this workflow youâ€™re going to analyze the data with the Tuxedo workflow.
#
#The workflow also performs quality control of the data with FastQC: first, on the input FASTQ files and, second, after the pre-processing step.
#
#Besides intermediate files and FastQC reports, the final result of the workflow running is a merged FASTQ file. If mapping was selected, the output would also contain a BAM file with aligned reads and other TopHat output files.
