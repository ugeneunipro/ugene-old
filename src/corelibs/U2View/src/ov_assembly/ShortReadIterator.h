 * Iterator for Next-Gen Sequencing short reads based on CIGAR model 
 * (see enum U2CigarOp for details about CIGAR operations). Provides transparent
 * iterations through read sequence, skipping clipping/padding/insertions and 
 * returning special symbols when going through deletions or skipped regions.
 *
 * Handling of CIGAR operations:
 * 1. Hard clips (H) and padding (P) operations are silently skipped.
 * 2. Soft clips (S) and insertions (I) do present in read sequence. So this operations
 *    are skipped together with the corresponding letters of the sequence.
 * 3. Deletions (D) and skipped regions (N) are 'virtual letters'. Iterator returns gap
 *    symbol when iterating through them.
 * 4. Matches/mismatches (M/=/X) are treated normally.
