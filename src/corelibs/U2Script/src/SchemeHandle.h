/*
 * This function creates new Single Algorithm Scheme then runs it with Workflow Designer
 * 
 * The `algorithmType` has to contain some Workflow Designer element type name
 * which is considered to suit for SAS
 *
 * `inputPath` and `outputPath` has to contain path to input file for the required algorithm
 * and path for output file with results respectively.
 *
 * After the invocation `*outputFilesCount` contains a count of files produced by calculating
 * scheme and `outputFileNames` contains their paths.
 * IMPORTANT: `outputFileNames` is dynamically allocated array of C-strings. Its each item
 * and array at whole should be deallocated explicitly by `free( )` function.
 *
 * Possible returning error codes:
 * U2_OK -                      success
 * U2_ELEMENT_NOT_SUIT_SAS -    the `algorithmType` contains an element type name
 *                                  that does not suit for SAS
 * U2_FAILED_TO_CREATE_DIR -    failed to create a directory for temporary files
 * U2_FAILED_TO_CREATE_FILE -   failed to create temporary file describing scheme
 * U2_INVALID_CALL -            UGENE environment has not been properly initialized
 * U2_INVALID_STRING -          at least one argument is null pointer
 * U2_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY -       processing of computational scheme ran out of memory
 * U2_UNKNOWN_ELEMENT -         the element with the type name `algorithmType`
 *                                  does not exist or it is unsupported
 *
 * If returning value is not U2_OK the environment is not affected by the invocation.
