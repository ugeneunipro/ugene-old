/** GUrl is designed to provide an easy to use and error prone implementation or URL for
DocumentModel in UGENE.
The core of GUrl is string based representation of an URL: urlString.
GUrl class enforces urlString to be always in correct canonical form.
All oter fields are supplementary.

Note: that 2 GUrls are considered equals if the urlStrings are equal.

Warning: in the current state GUrl canonical form can contain symlinks.
         2 GUrls with different symlinks to the same target are not equal!

* Why not QUrl - QUrl is too error prone and requires a lot of external code to support valid state.
* Why not QString - requires external utils to represent all urls in canonical form. Can't be to extended.
